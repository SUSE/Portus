  # Portus needs an email for each user, but there's no standard way to get
  # that from LDAP servers. You can tell Portus how to get the email from users
  # registered in the LDAP server with this configurable value. There are three
  # possibilities:
  #
  #   - disabled: this is the default value. It means that Portus won't do a
  #     thing when registering LDAP users (users will be redirected to their
  #     profile page until they setup an email account).
  #   - enabled where "attr" is empty: for this you need "ldap.base" to have
  #     some value. In this case, the hostname will be guessed from the domain
  #     component of the provided base string. For example, for the dn:
  #     "ou=users,dc=example,dc=com", and a user name "user", the resulting
  #     email is "user@example.com".
  #   - enabled where "attr" is not empty: with this you specify the attribute
  #     inside a LDIF record where the email is set.
  #
  # If something goes wrong when trying to guess the email, then it just falls
  # back to the default behavior (empty email).
