# Portus [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SUSE/Portus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SUSE/Portus) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/SUSE/Portus/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/SUSE/Portus) [![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/SUSE/Portus/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/SUSE/Portus/coverage)

Portus is an authoritzation server and a user interface for the next generation
of the Docker registry. Portus targets
[version 2](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/api.md)
of the Docker Registry API. The minimum required version of Registry is 2.1,
which is the first version supporting soft deletes of blobs.

## Features

### Fine-grained control of permissions

Portus supports the concept of users and teams. Users have their own personal
Docker namespace where they have both read (aka `docker pull`) and write (aka
`docker push`) access. A team is a group of users that have read and write
access to a certain namespace. You can read more about this in our
[documentation page about it](http://port.us.org/features/3_teams_namespaces_and_users.html).

Portus implements the [token based authentication system](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/auth/token.md)
described by the new version of the Docker registry. This can be used to have
full control over the images served by an instance of the Docker registry.

### Web interface for Docker registry

Portus provides quick access to all the images available on your private
instance of Docker registry. User's privileges are taken into account to
make sure private images (the ones requiring special rights also for
`docker pull`) are not shown to unauthorized personnel.

### Self-hosted

Portus allows you to host everything on your servers, on your own
infrastructure. You don't have to trust a third-party service, just own
everything yourself. Take a look at our
[documentation](http://port.us.org/documentation.html) to read the different
setups in which you can deploy Portus.

### And more!
