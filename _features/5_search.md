## Search

Portus has the ability to search for repositories. The searching is done by
clicking on the search element that can be found in the top bar. After doing
this, you can write what you're looking for and click enter. Something like
this:

![Search](/build/images/docs/search.png)

The found repositories abide to the permissions of the current user. Therefore,
it's not possible for a user to accidentally find a repository that is out of
his scope.

**Pro tip**: you can access the search widget without using the mouse. There's
a shortcut for it: \<Ctrl\>\<Space\>.
