## Recovering the password

Users can recover their password with a straight-forward procedure. First of
all, users have to click the `I forgot my password` link in the login form.

![Forgot](/build/images/docs/forgot.png)

This will redirect users to a form that asks for their email. If users deliver
their email, they'll receive an email with further instructions. To sum it up,
they will receive a link to this page:

![Reset password](/build/images/docs/reset-password.png)

In order for all this to work, you have to configure how Portus sends emails. If
you want to know more about this, make sure to read
[this](/docs/Configuring-Portus.html#email-configuration).
