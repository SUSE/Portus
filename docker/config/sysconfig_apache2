# This allows you to add e.g. VirtualHost statements without touching

# All files contained in these directories will be recursively included by apache.
# If a pattern like *.conf is appended, apache will use it.
#
# Examples: "/etc/apache2/my_conf/"

#           "local/*.conf /srv/www/virtual/"

# [It might look silly to not simply edit httpd.conf for the LoadModule statements.
# However, since the LoadModule statements might need an absolute path to the modules,
# switching between MPMs can be quite a hassle. It's easier to just give the names here.]

#
# * It pays to use IfDefine statements... like
#    <IfModule mod_xyz.c>
#        ....
#    </IfModule>
#
# * In the APACHE_MODULES variable, you can use mod_xyz or just xyz syntax.
#   You may also name an absolute path if you like.
#
# * NOTE ON SSL: before you can use mod_ssl, you need a server certificate. 
#   A test certificate can be created by (as root):
#   cd /usr/share/doc/packages/apache2; /bin/sh ./mkcert.sh make --no-print-directory /usr/bin/openssl /usr/sbin/ test
#   Please feel free to have a look at the mkcert.sh script to see how certificates can be created.
#   Also, you need to set the ServerName inside the <VirtualHost _default_:443> 
#   block to the fully qualified domain name (see /etc/HOSTNAME).
# * if your server certificate is protected by a passphrase you should increase the
#   APACHE_START_TIMEOUT (see above)
# * to finally enable ssl support, you need to add 'SSL' to APACHE_SERVER_FLAGS 
#   below.
#
# * modules listed here will be ignored if they are not installed

# Additional server flags:
#
# Put here any server flags ("Defines") that you want to hand over to 
# httpd at start time, or other command line flags.
#
# Background: Any directives within an <IfDefine flag>...</IfDefine>
#             section are only processed if the flag is defined.
#             This allows to write configuration which is active only in a
#             special cases, like during server maintenance, or for testing
#             something temporarily.
#
# Notably, to enable ssl support, 'SSL' needs to be added here.
# To enable the server-status, 'STATUS' needs to be added here.
#
# It does not matter if you write flag1, -D flag1 or -Dflag1.
# Multiple flags can be given as "-D flag1 -D flag2" or simply "flag1 flag2".
#
# Specifying such flags here is equivalent to giving them on the commandline.
# (e.g. via rcapache2 start -DReverseProxy)
#
# Example:
#      "SSL STATUS AWSTATS SVN_VIEWCVS no_subversion_today"

# Which config file do you want to use?
# (if not set, /etc/apache2/httpd.conf is used.)
# It is unusual to need to use this setting.
#
# Note about ulimits:
#   if you want to set ulimits, e.g. to increase the max number of open file handle, 
#   or to allow core files, you can do so by editing /etc/sysconfig/apache2 and
#   simply write the ulimit commands into that file.
#   Example:
#     ulimit -n 16384
#     ulimit -H -n 16384
#     ulimit -c unlimited
#   See the output of "help ulimit" in the bash, or "man 1 ulimit".
